  <h2><b>What is Sustainable Development Goals?</b></h2>
  <p>The <b>United Nations</b> created the <b>17 Global Objectives</b> known as the <b>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b> in 2015. They were established to tackle the world's most urgent issues, such as access to healthcare and education, poverty, hunger, inequality, and climate change.</p>
  <p>These objectives seek to offer a common blueprint for world peace and prosperity, both now and in the future. Every goal has precise objectives and metrics to track advancement and guarantee responsibility.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve sustainable development, the SDGs encourage collaboration between nations, communities, corporations, and individuals. The world can build a more resilient, environmentally sustainable, and equitable future for all by adhering to this framework.</p>
